- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @karanshah0206
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in solving random problems using a computer (and also playing the guitar)
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Computer Science at Swinburne University of Technology
- ğŸ‘… C++ is my favorite language, C# comes close, Rust is pretty good as well. Python is the worst.
